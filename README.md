# styleoverflow

This application utilizes the MEAN stack, MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js, in order to create a Reddit/StackOverflow clone, but with the exclusive purpose of style and fashion topics.
StyleOverflow was made by creating a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.
